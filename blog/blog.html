          <h4>In our daily lives we see and meet lots of new people and with the people we know. Tensed or not, but yes, always blame each other for this and that. But the main fact is that, we don’t accept what it is and what it is for. Some may feel depressed and some may feel the awkwardness towards the society, anxiety is what that is if not else. And the most striking fact about this is someone from somewhere always looks at you and always try to take the advantage. Kills you and then people think it is a suicide.</h4>

          <h4>In reality, we suppress our anxiety and try to get away with it just by sharing it with the people we don’t know in real life. That’s where the mistake takes place. We unknowingly share things that may hamper our lives later in future by someone we don’t even know who. And then suddenly newspapers press the news as SUICIDE, but in reality it was pre-planned murder. Many people still believe that suicide is a case where no one is to be blamed, but in reality, there’s always a murderer. Be it a suicide case for the one you loved, be it a suicide case for the all the problems that had been caused by someone, be it a suicide case of deep anxiety and depression because of the total catastrophic pressure from your institution, business, home, etc…..
These are actually all murders, not suicide cases!
This is a new generation where people believe in realism, but in fact, we always fantasize everything. We think things are going well, going worse, going steady, but in reality it is exactly the opposite.

          <h4>There’s still time that we must understand that, committing suicide outcomes nothing but suffer and misery for your own people and the people you know. You have just transferred the problem to your family and relatives and friends. Try to solve it, no matter what happens, just fight it back. And it is a crime, you should stand against crimes, but not be a part of it instead. Make your life better, don’t make your life more miserable than it was before.</h4>
